I am a second year Computer Science and Math student at Caltech, where I am advised by Professor Anima Anandkumar. I am passionate about applying machine learning to big problems, including climate change, disaster response, defense, medicine, etc. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that leverage these technologies to make a positive impact.

I am currently working as the David C. Elliot SURF Fellow at Caltech under Professor Hannah Druckenmiller. We are working to develop a model that detects new construction from satellite imagery with the goal of quantifying Clean Water Act land use regulation non-compliance.
