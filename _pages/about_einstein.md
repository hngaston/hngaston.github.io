I am a second-year student Computer Science and Mathematics student at Caltech, where I am advised by Professor Anima Anandkumar.

I am passionate about applying machine learning to big problems, including climate change, disaster response, defense, medicine, etc. I am eager to contribute to innovative projects that leverage these technologies to make a positive impact.

I am currently working as the David C. Elliot SURF Fellow at Caltech under Professor Hannah Druckenmiller. We are building a model that detects new construction from satellite imagery with the goal of quantifying Clean Water Act land use regulation non-compliance. Previously, I worked with Professor Zhiwei Feng at the University of Pittsburgh to develop a fully computational pipeline for antibody design.

I am actively searching for work co-op opportunities and Summer 2026 internships. If you would like to talk, please reach out!
